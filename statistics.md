### Statistics and sampling distributions

> **Statistic**: A characteristic of a sample, if $X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_n$ is a random sample of size $n$ then a statistic $T$ is a random variable made of any function of $X_i$.

For example $\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3}{3}$ is a statistic because it only uses the samples, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\frac{|X_i - \mu|}{n})$ is not a statistic because it contains $\mu$, a population parameter.

> **Sampling Distribution**: Since sampling can be repeated, the sampling distribution of $T$ is a probability distribution for the given statistic.
