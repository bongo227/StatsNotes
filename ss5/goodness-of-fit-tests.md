# Goodness of fit tests

#### Degrees of freedom

Degrees of freedom is a measure of the data _not_ used up. Every time a statistic is calculated or constraint put in place, a degree of freedom is used. For the purpose of testing the fit of a distribution the total frequency of the model must equal the observed frequency. This is an example of a constraint so we lose a degree of freedom.
