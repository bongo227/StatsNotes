## Students t-distribution
If the population variance is unknown we know and $$X$$ follows a normal distribution then provided $$n$$ was large:
$$
\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}} \approx N(0, 1^2)
$$

However if $$n$$ is small we can use t-distribution to get a better estimate.
$$
\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}} \approx t_{n-1}\text{-distribution}
$$
