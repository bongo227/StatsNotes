## Continuity corrections
When we go from a discrete distribution to a continuous distribution, we must account for the discrete nature of the problem in are calculations.

For example, let $$X$$ be the number of heads after 10 flips of a coin, find the $$P(X = 4)$$. If we approximate the value with a continuose distribution we must find the area under the curve between $$0.35$$ and $$0.45$$ since these are the lower and upper limits of $$4$$.
